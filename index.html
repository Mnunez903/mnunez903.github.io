  <h1>LANLEY</h1>

<p>I recently attended a Q&amp;A Session with Martin Fowler. Mr. Fowler is known for many of his tech books, including <strong>Refactoring</strong>, and <strong>Domain Specific Languages</strong>. In the talk, there was a piece on being interested in multiple languages. Someone who may be a Front-End developer should be interested in Back-End related work and vice versa. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good colleague of mine mentioned &ldquo;Learn a New Language Every Year.&rdquo; Every developer should strive to learn at least one new language every year. When you do, you can expand your thinking capabilities when solving complex problems&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to run through my years in this entry. I definitely have some catching up to do!</p>

<h2>Before my Career &ndash; College</h2>

<p>In college, I was a really big <strong><em>C#</em></strong> individual. My final project was in <strong><em>C#</em></strong>, and thought it was the best programming language ever! I definitely enjoyed the concept of OOP, and I wanted to expand on that programming model. It wasn&rsquo;t until a year later where I landed my first job.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<h3>2011</h3>

<p>I worked at a consulting company where their clients were predominately finance companies. Got a chance to work at an Investment Bank in Stamford, CT. This position was all <strong><em>Java</em></strong>. Once I was collecting a paycheck, I had completely forgot about <strong><em>C#</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>2012</h3>

<p>Still at the same client, but was heavily interested in <strong><em>Test Driven Development</em></strong>. My boss said while testing is useful, it eats up too much time, and he didn&rsquo;t want to do it in our project. He managed to find a team that would work with me within the company where I was able to write some tests! The team used <strong><em>TestNG</em></strong>. It had a difficult learning curve for me, but I got over it. Testing was fun, but it wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;til next year where I got more familiar with <strong><em>TDD</em></strong>. This isn&rsquo;t a language learning per se, but it was a new (testing) framework.</p>

<h3>2013</h3>

<p>I joined another consulting company (pattern, much?) that was big on <strong><em>TDD</em></strong>, The Agile Methodology, and Pairing. Here, I had to pick up <strong><em>Ruby</em></strong>, <strong><em>Rails</em></strong>, and learn a little <strong><em>Twitter Bootstrap.</em></strong> I had a lot of fun test driving features with a pair. It was really comfortable to be able to learn good practices, and having someone help get rid of bad habits was also a plus! I definitely enjoyed developing in <strong><em>Ruby</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>2014</h3>

<p>Sadly enough, 2014 was the same as 2013. Each client I worked on was pretty much a <strong><em>Rails</em></strong> project. I did get better throughout time with <strong><em>TDD</em></strong> which is always helpful.</p>

<h3>2015</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where I was forced to switch it up! <strong><em>React</em></strong> was a hot commodity, so I had dived head first into <strong><em>Javascript</em></strong>. That felt difficult, but definitely got over it relatively quick. That includes testing in <strong><em>React</em></strong> using <strong><em>Jasmine</em></strong>. It was a ton of fun! I continue to be working on <strong><em>React</em></strong> at the moment!</p>

<h3>2016</h3>

<p>As of right now, I&rsquo;m still at a place that uses <strong><em>React</em></strong>. On my own, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn <strong><em>Elixir</em></strong>. <strong><em>Elixir</em></strong> is part of the reason I started this blog. I look forward to what I will be doing with <strong><em>Elixir</em></strong>, but the end of the year is coming up soon!!</p>

<p>According to the quote above, I may have missed 2 languages (2012 and 2014). What&rsquo;s next for 2017? I don&rsquo;t know. Any new Languages? Maybe a new framework? We&rsquo;ll see! One thing is for sure:</p>

<h3>Learn a New Language Every Year!</h3>

  <h2><a href="/2016/09/29/list-and-recursion-2-official-post.html">List and Recursion 2</a> <span>Sep 29</span></h2>

  <h1><strong><strong>Elixir</strong></strong></h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading the Programming Elixir book by Dave Thomas, which has been
very good so far! Slowly but surely, I&rsquo;m picking up some Elixir skills. I maybe should start from the beginning sometime soon, but now that I&rsquo;m starting to blog in the middle of the book, I&rsquo;ll just start with the current problem, and try to fill in any weird Elixir tricks.</p>

<p><em>Exercise: ListAndRecursion-2</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Write a <code>max(list)</code> that returns the element with the maximum value in the list (This
is slightly trickier than it sounds.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the solution is what I came up to get it to work. I will talk about some mistakes that I made along the way
and fix up the final solution.</p>

<p>Here is my solution:</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">true</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">false</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">b</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([],</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">value</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">]),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let me try to explain.</p>

<p>When using <code>findMaxNumber(list)</code> with the <code>list = [0,1,5,2]</code>, we call the first function.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>iex(1)&gt; findMaxNumber(list)
</code></pre>
<p>Which then matches</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">]),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In Elixir, and many other languages, a List is simply two nodes, where <code>head</code> is the first item in the list, while the tail is the rest of the items.</p>

<p>So when an array of <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code> is broken down, <code>head = 1</code> while <code>tail = [2,3,4,5]</code></p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>ends up calling</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>which looks like the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">]],</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>and calls <code>findMaxNumber</code> recursively while passing in the function <code>choose</code>. <code>choose</code> would return the greater value of the two
values. It looks like this:</p>

<p><code>findMaxNumber([5,2], choose(1, 0, 1&gt;0))</code></p>

<p>since <code>1&gt;0</code>, the choose function <code>def choose(a, _, true), do: a</code> will match, since it&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>then calls <code>findMaxNumber</code> again with the new variables:</p>

<p><code>findMaxNumber([5|[2]], 1)</code></p>

<p>This time, <code>head</code> will be greater than <code>value</code>! so the recursive function</p>

<p><code>findMaxNumber([2], choose(5, 1, 5&gt;1))</code> would make <code>choose</code> return true.</p>

<p>the next iteration would look like this: <br/>
<code>def findMaxNumber([2|[]], 5), do:</code> <br/>
<code>findMaxNumber([], choose(2, 5, 2&gt;5))</code><br/></p>

<p><code>choose(2, 5, 2&gt;5))</code> would match the false choose function which is <code>def choose(_, b, false), do: b</code>
and 5 would remain the higher value.</p>

<p>Since the last function will be <code>findMaxNumber([], value)</code>, it would just return the value!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the solution. There&rsquo;s an  issue I need to get to.</p>

<h2>Refactor Time</h2>

<p>First, I noticed I can refactor the <code>choose</code> functions.</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">true</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">false</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre>
<p>can be</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">when</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">when</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to refactor the function this far&hellip;</p>
<pre class="highlight elixir"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">when</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">when</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">b</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">head</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">]),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">findMaxNumber</span><span class="p">([],</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Definitely fun stuff!</p>
