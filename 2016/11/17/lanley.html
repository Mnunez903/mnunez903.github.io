        <h1>LANLEY</h1>

<p>I recently attended a Q&amp;A Session with Martin Fowler. Mr. Fowler is known for many of his tech books, including <strong>Refactoring</strong>, and <strong>Domain Specific Languages</strong>. In the talk, there was a piece on being interested in multiple languages. Someone who may be a Front-End developer should be interested in Back-End related work and vice versa. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good colleague of mine mentioned &ldquo;Learn a New Language Every Year.&rdquo; Every developer should strive to learn at least one new language every year. When you do, you can expand your thinking capabilities when solving complex problems&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to run through my years in this entry. I definitely have some catching up to do!</p>

<h2>Before my Career &ndash; College</h2>

<p>In college, I was a really big <strong><em>C#</em></strong> individual. My final project was in <strong><em>C#</em></strong>, and thought it was the best programming language ever! I definitely enjoyed the concept of OOP, and I wanted to expand on that programming model. It wasn&rsquo;t until a year later where I landed my first job.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<h3>2011</h3>

<p>I worked at a consulting company where their clients were predominately finance companies. Got a chance to work at an Investment Bank in Stamford, CT. This position was all <strong><em>Java</em></strong>. Once I was collecting a paycheck, I had completely forgot about <strong><em>C#</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>2012</h3>

<p>Still at the same client, but was heavily interested in <strong><em>Test Driven Development</em></strong>. My boss said while testing is useful, it eats up too much time, and he didn&rsquo;t want to do it in our project. He managed to find a team that would work with me within the company where I was able to write some tests! The team used <strong><em>TestNG</em></strong>. It had a difficult learning curve for me, but I got over it. Testing was fun, but it wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;til next year where I got more familiar with <strong><em>TDD</em></strong>. This isn&rsquo;t a language learning per se, but it was a new (testing) framework.</p>

<h3>2013</h3>

<p>I joined another consulting company (pattern, much?) that was big on <strong><em>TDD</em></strong>, The Agile Methodology, and Pairing. Here, I had to pick up <strong><em>Ruby</em></strong>, <strong><em>Rails</em></strong>, and learn a little <strong><em>Twitter Bootstrap.</em></strong> I had a lot of fun test driving features with a pair. It was really comfortable to be able to learn good practices, and having someone help get rid of bad habits was also a plus! I definitely enjoyed developing in <strong><em>Ruby</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>2014</h3>

<p>Sadly enough, 2014 was the same as 2013. Each client I worked on was pretty much a <strong><em>Rails</em></strong> project. I did get better throughout time with <strong><em>TDD</em></strong> which is always helpful.</p>

<h3>2015</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where I was forced to switch it up! <strong><em>React</em></strong> was a hot commodity, so I had dived head first into <strong><em>Javascript</em></strong>. That felt difficult, but definitely got over it relatively quick. That includes testing in <strong><em>React</em></strong> using <strong><em>Jasmine</em></strong>. It was a ton of fun! I continue to be working on <strong><em>React</em></strong> at the moment!</p>

<h3>2016</h3>

<p>As of right now, I&rsquo;m still at a place that uses <strong><em>React</em></strong>. On my own, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn <strong><em>Elixir</em></strong>. <strong><em>Elixir</em></strong> is part of the reason I started this blog. I look forward to what I will be doing with <strong><em>Elixir</em></strong>, but the end of the year is coming up soon!!</p>

<p>According to the quote above, I may have missed 2 languages (2012 and 2014). What&rsquo;s next for 2017? I don&rsquo;t know. Any new Languages? Maybe a new framework? We&rsquo;ll see! One thing is for sure:</p>

<h3>Learn a New Language Every Year!</h3>
